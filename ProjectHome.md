This tool was initially designed as a mod merging tool for Egosoft's X3: Terran Conflict. Since then the immediate scope has been expanded to cover X3: Albion Prelude.

The long-term ambition is to support all versions of Egosoft's X series of games and help with the porting and merging of modded material.

The overarching design principle of the tool is to hide the complexity of how the mod data is stored by the game behind a friendly user interface.

Includes an embedded light-weight tree and node attribute list based XML Editor that could be used in other applications.

Developed using .NET 4.0 and Visual C# 2010 Express.
